      historyTitle: 'History of Linguaphone',
      historyText: 'Linguaphone was founded in 1901 and is one of the most established international language education providers in the world. Over the years, millions of people in more than 60 countries have improved their careers and enhanced their lives by learning a new language with The Linguaphone Group. Linguaphone uses a global network of trusted licensed partners and distributors to make sure its courses are available to both adults and children around the world. This includes licensed language schools such as Direct English and Pingu’s English. As one of the first to combine written course materials with audio resources, Linguaphone quickly became a leader in international language teaching. Today, Linguaphone’s well-known language programs include Linguaphone, Pingu’s English, and Direct English, which now also incorporate modern teaching methods and digital learning tools.',
      schoolTitle: "Pingu's English School",
      schoolText: "An award-winning TV show that’s loved by children and parents alike, Pingu™ was chosen for its universal appeal and accessibility, as well as the strong moral message it represents. Building on this beloved show, Pingu’s English was developed after HIT Entertainment (now part of Mattel) granted exclusive English teaching rights in Febuary 2006. With over a century of expertise from Linguaphone Group, the program uses proven play-based learning, creative activities, and high-quality resources designed by UK experts. Stories, songs, games, and digital tools make learning fun, interactive, and engaging, helping children gain confidence in English while enjoying the adventures of Pingu.",
      directorTitle: 'A Message From the Director',
      directorName: 'Director May',
      directorMessage: "A leader who speaks English effectively and can communicate with people around the world is a valuable leader. English is spoken in more than 90 countries around the world, and more than 1 billion people use English as their first and second language. Pingu's English School aims to develop Lao children into children who can speak English fluently, use a variety of vocabulary and motivate listeners. We want to lay the foundation for Lao children to become good leaders in the future. When it comes to developing children into high-quality adults in the future, we need to develop and nurture children from an early age. Especially language learning, as children's brains develop and grow from 0 to 8 years old. The younger the child the better. They will learn faster and more effectively. I strongly believe that the Pingu's English Laos, designed by a group of linguists with 110 years of experience teaching English, will inspire Lao children to have fun, and enjoy learning English effectively and comprehensively.",
