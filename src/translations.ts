      historyTitle: 'History of Linguaphone',
      historyText: 'Linguaphone was founded in 1901 and is one of the most established international language education providers in the world. Over the years, millions of people in more than 60 countries have improved their careers and enhanced their lives by learning a new language with The Linguaphone Group. Linguaphone uses a global network of trusted licensed partners and distributors to make sure its courses are available to both adults and children around the world. This includes licensed language schools such as Direct English and Pingu\'s English. As one of the first to combine written course materials with audio resources, Linguaphone quickly became a leader in international language teaching. Today, Linguaphone\'s well-known language programs include Linguaphone, Pingu\'s English, and Direct English, which now also incorporate modern teaching methods and digital learning tools.',
      schoolTitle: "Pingu\'s English School",
      schoolText: "Pingu is an award winning, globally loved TV show cherished by both children and parents for its universal appeal, entertaining storylines, and positive moral lessons. Building on this beloved character, Pingu\'s English was developed after HIT Entertainment (now part of the global toy giant Mattel) granted exclusive English teaching rights to the Linguaphone Group in February 2006. This partnership created a premier international English language course designed specifically for young learners. Combining over a century of language training expertise from the UK based Linguaphone Group with high quality resources, our program provides a solid foundation, helping children master all four key language skills, including listening, speaking, reading, and writing from an early age.",
      directorTitle: 'A Message From the CEO',
      directorName: 'CEO',
      directorMessage: "A leader who speaks English effectively and can communicate with people around the world is a valuable leader. English is spoken in more than 90 countries around the world, and more than 1 billion people use English as their first and second language. Pingu\'s English School aims to develop Lao children into children who can speak English fluently, use a variety of vocabulary and motivate listeners. We want to lay the foundation for Lao children to become good leaders in the future. When it comes to developing children into high-quality adults in the future, we need to develop and nurture children from an early age. Especially language learning, as children\'s brains develop and grow from 0 to 8 years old. The younger the child the better. They will learn faster and more effectively. I strongly believe that the Pingu\'s English Laos, designed by a group of linguists with 110 years of experience teaching English, will inspire Lao children to have fun, and enjoy learning English effectively and comprehensively.",

        "My child absolutely loves it here and looks forward to class every week, constantly talking about the teachers! I never expected such fast progress, but watching the school's video updates, I was amazed by how many vocabulary words they’ve already learned. Seeing my child smile throughout every lesson brings me the greatest joy as a parent. Thank you, Pingu's English, for inspiring children to love learning English!",
        "This is such a fun place to learn English because they offer a wonderful variety of activities that kids love, from interactive games to singing and dancing. Most importantly, learning directly with Native English-speaking teachers helps children naturally absorb and master the correct accent from a very young age. Since my grandchild (niece/nephew) started classes here, I can clearly see how much they enjoy it. They have become far more confident, expressive, and their English speaking skills have improved noticeably."
